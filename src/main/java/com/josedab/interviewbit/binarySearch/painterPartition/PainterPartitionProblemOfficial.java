/**
 * You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}.
 * There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board.
 * You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter
 * will only paint contiguous sections of board.

     2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
     cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
     A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
     configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
     invalid.
     Return the ans % 10000003

     Input :
     K : Number of painters
     T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
     L : A List which will represent length of each board

     Output:
     return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
     Example

     Input :
     K : 2
     T : 5
     L : [1, 10]
     Output : 50

    Hint 1 : Think binary search for the answer.

    If you had a function bool isPossible which could tell you if its possible to
    paint the boards in time T or less, can you solve the problem ?

    Hint 2:
    If you have already solved the problem corresponding to hint1, you are already halfway there.

    You can do a binary search for the answer :

      start = 0, end = max_time_possible
      mid = (start + end) / 2
      if isPossible(mid):
        end = mid - 1
      else
        start = mid + 1
    Now, lets look into how isPossible would be implemented.
    Keep assigning boards to painter greedily till the time taken < mid. If you run out of painters, isPossible = false.
    else isPossible = true.
