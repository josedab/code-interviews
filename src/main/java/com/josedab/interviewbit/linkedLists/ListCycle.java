/**
 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

 Try solving it using constant additional space.

 Example :

 Input :

            ______
           |     |
           \/    |
 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

 Return the node corresponding to node 3.

 Note: with additional space, the solution is given on {@link ListCycleWithSet}

 Solution approach:
 2 pointer approach ( Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm ) :
 What if you have 2 pointers which are going at different speed. For arguments sake, lets just say one pointer is going at double the speed of the other.
 Would they meet if there is a cycle ? Are they guaranteed to meet if there is a cycle ?
 What happens if there is no cycle ?

 Once you detect a cycle, think about finding the starting point.
