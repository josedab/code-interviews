/**
 * There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line.
 Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
 A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
 Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

 Example:

 positions of mice are:
 4 -4 2
 positions of holes are:
 4 0 5

 Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes
 Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes
 Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes
 After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.

 Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4,
 answer = 4.
 Input:

 A :  list of positions of mice
 B :  list of positions of holes
 Output:

 single integer value
 NOTE: The final answer will fit in a 32 bit signed integer.
